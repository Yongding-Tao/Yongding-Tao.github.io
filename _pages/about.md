I'm a third year undergraduate student from [School of Mathematics](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/), [UESTC](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). My research interest includes computer vision, machine learning, NLP and code generation.

I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Liangjian Deng](https://www.XXX.com/)

You can find my CV here: [Yongding Tao's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
