# About Me

I'm a third year undergraduate student from School of Mathematics, UESTC.  I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Liangjian Deng](https://liangjiandeng.github.io/). I will begin my Ph.D. studies at the School of Computer Science, Peking University in 2025, under the supervision of Prof. [Ge Li](https://ligechina.github.io/).

My current research interests are mainly focused on AI for Software Engineering (AI4SE), encompassing software engineering and natural language processing (NLP) technologies.
